## Tech Stack : React | TypeScript | Tailwind | Framer Motion

Welcome to my first website built with Tailwind CSS!  
This project was an exciting journey where I learned a lot about responsive design, animations, and managing React states.

## Overview

This project showcases my ability to build a responsive and visually appealing website using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion for animations.  
I tackled several challenges along the way and gained valuable insights into planning and organizing a design system.

## Features
- **Responsive Design:** Utilized Tailwind CSS to create a fully responsive website.
- **Animations:** Integrated Framer Motion to add smooth animations.
- **Form Handling:** Implemented form functionality with efficient state management in React.

## What I'm Proud Of
Creating this website was a significant milestone for me. I'm particularly proud of:
- The overall design and responsiveness.
- Successfully incorporating animations with Framer Motion.
- Figuring out solutions on the fly and learning new techniques.

## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I encountered and overcame several challenges:
- **React State Management:** Understanding that React retains the previous state and learning to use `useEffect` to keep the form selections updated.
- **Tailwind CSS Setup:** Realizing the importance of pre-defining brand colors and fonts for an easier and more efficient design process.
